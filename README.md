# IPL-Data-Analysis
1. Take the win_by_wickets dataset and plot frequency distribution graph  On x-axis - Win by Wickets on y-axis Win by Wickets margin  
2. Relative frequency distribution graph using the same data set win_by_wickets  Hint: use normalize = True argument for pandas.Series.value_counts  Instead of showing frequency show percentage of values  
3. Plot Cumulative relative frequency graph  Use function pandas.Series.cumsum  
4. Find out the probability of winning a match by 6 wickets or less?  Find out the probability using the cumulative relative frequency graph  Draw a vertical line from 6 on x-axis till it intercepts the curve and the draw the horizontal line till it intercepts y-axis  Hint: Answer is 54%  
5. Plot the normal distribution for win_by_wickets data.  Calculate mean and standard deviation for win_by_wickets data  Plot Histogram  Plot Line Graph  Plot Normal distribution between 1 and 10 using mean and standard deviation as calculated above  
6. Calculate z-score if the team wins by 35 runs.  Calculate mean and standard deviation for win_by_wickets data  Use win_by_runs dataset  
7. Calculate percentile using z-score.  Use scipy.stats.norm.cdf function

Hint: use normalize = True argument for pandas.Series.value_counts
Instead of showing frequency show percentage of values

Q4. Find out the probability of winning a match by 6 wickets or less?
Find out the probability using the cumulative relative frequency graph
Draw a vertical line from 6 on x-axis till it intercepts the curve and the draw the horizontal line till it intercepts y-axis
Hint: Answer is 54%

From the Above results we can say that The Probability of winning a match by 6 wickets or less wickets is Approximately :- 0.54 = 54%
But only when if we dont count the win by 0 wickets!!!!

7. Calculate percentile using z-score.
Use scipy.stats.norm.cdf function
In [40]:
# Percentile when data has 0 value in it!!!
z0 = norm.cdf(zscore0_35)
print(" Percentile using Z Score when data have 0 value in it :- ",z0," = ",z0*100,"%")
 Percentile using Z Score when data have 0 value in it :-  0.8225848873441655  =  82.25848873441655 %
In [41]:
# Percentile when data don't have 0 value in it!!!
z = norm.cdf(zscore_35)
print(" Percentile using Z Score when data don't have 0 value in it :- ",z," = ",z*100,"%")
 Percentile using Z Score when data don't have 0 value in it :-  0.5756078531581299  =  57.56078531581299 %
